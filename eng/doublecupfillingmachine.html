            <h4>Koru Machine</h4>
         <p><strong> Quality, reliability, fast delivery</strong></p>
<p>The fully automatic ayran filling machine is an industrial filling system designed to quickly and hygienically fill ayran into bottles, glasses, or other packaging.</p>
<p>It is used primarily in dairy factories, beverage manufacturers, and ayran production workshops.</p>
<p> It automatically performs product feeding, filling, capping, and labeling processes on a single line.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-8" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
          <h3>KORU DOUBLE ROTARY CUP FILLING MACHINE WORKING PRINCIPLE</h3><br><br>
            <p>
           <strong>TABLE</strong> Our machine is connected to a motor and reducer, driven by a mechanical transmission, and rotates the rotating table located on top. The sockets on the rotating table are designed to fit a single type of glass.
</p>
<p><strong>DROP</strong> The glasses are automatically dropped in groups of four. Vacuum at the bottom separates the glasses and ensures they fit into the holder.</p>
<p><strong>VOLUMETRIC NOZZLE FILLING</strong>: When the photocell detects the glass, the filler fills the desired volumetric product into the glass in four pieces at a time (suitable for filling ayran and fermented milk).
</p>
<p><strong>LID PLACING</strong> The aluminum lids, arranged in groups of four in the holder, are automatically picked up by vacuum and placed on the glasses. <p><strong>LID RELEASE SYSTEM</strong> A custom design will be made based on the sample, consisting of two lid release devices driven by a single piston. The lid suction cups conform to the lid shape, and if they deform over time, they can be easily removed from their screws and replaced.</p>
<p><strong>CONTROL SENSOR</strong> The bowls with the lids placed pass under the lid control indicator sensor and arrive at the gluing station.</p>

<p><strong>GLUE</strong> The lids are adhered to the aluminum foil at the desired temperature. The temperature is adjusted via the digital display (TEMP CONTROL DEVICE) on the panel. Magnetic sensors on the adhesive piston prevent potential problems with the machine.</p>
<p><strong>EXIT CONVEYOR</strong> Finished products are lifted onto the conveyor by a lifting piston and a pusher arm, aligning the belt. The bowls will be manually collected from the belt by your designated personnel. The conveyor belt system is aligned with the holding brackets. The conveyor belt will be designed as a PU belt system, and non-slip wicks located under the belt will prevent rapid wear, extend the conveyor's life, and ensure longer use.</p>
<br><br>
<h4>ASSEMBLY AND INSTALLATION</h4>
              <img src="../assets/img/blog/12.jpg" alt=""><br><br><br><br>
         <p>
The assembly and installation of the machine will be carried out by the seller. However, it is the buyer's responsibility to bring the machine to the installation site.
</p>
<p>All technical needs and requirements for the assembly and installation of the machine will be met by the buyer. Air and electrical connections, as well as all necessary infrastructure work and procedures to make the machine(s) operational, will be prepared by the buyer in accordance with standards. Any problems arising from deficiencies or errors in these infrastructure procedures will not be covered by the warranty, and the buyer will be responsible for these.</p>
<p>After the assembly of all machinery and equipment is completed, the seller will test them, perform a trial production, and leave them operational. All raw materials and equipment for the trial production will be prepared by the buyer. If any problems occur during test and trial production, they will be corrected by the seller.</p>
<p>During assembly and installation, one employee designated by the buyer will receive hands-on training on operation, maintenance, and other matters.</p>
<p>The machine(s) will be delivered to the seller with an "Assembly-Training-Commissioning Report." After signing this report, the seller will not accept any claims that the machine did not perform in accordance with the sample and trial production.</p>
<p>The buyer is responsible for covering all accommodation and transportation expenses of the assembly and installation team. Transportation can only be provided by Turkish Airlines; if the buyer requests otherwise, the seller must obtain approval.</p>
<p>The seller's employees (minimum 1 person) will stay at the buyer's factory for 2 days for assembly. A service invoice will be issued if an additional day is requested. ASSEMBLY</p>
